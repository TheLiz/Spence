# Spence
Codewell project. Spense is a landing page for writers. Great for practicing absolute positioning and flex layouts.

I found the images to be absurdly large, so I resized, compressed, and even exported a few alternative versions in .webp and .avif formats for browsers that can support them. Each image has width and height attributes added to avoid layout shift. Offscreen images have native lazy loading attributes.

I also didn't like the lack of contrast in this project, so I tweaked some of the colors to meet WCAG 2.0 compliance.

It seemed strange to use SVG icons for the list items and hamburger menu, but not for the logos, so I found SVG versions and inlined them to save http requests.
